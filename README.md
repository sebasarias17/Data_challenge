## Project Overview
This repository contains solutions to a data challenge designed for the Endava Internship 2024-2. The challenge involves several algorithmic problems that test various data manipulation and computational skills.

## Files Included
- [**README.md**](https://github.com/sebasarias17/Data_challenge/blob/main/README.md)
- [**maximum_gold.py**](https://github.com/sebasarias17/Data_challenge/blob/main/maximum_gold.py): Solution to the maximum gold problem.
- [**merge_arrays.py**](https://github.com/sebasarias17/Data_challenge/blob/main/merge_arrays.py): Code for merging sorted arrays.
- [**shortest_node_path.py**](https://github.com/sebasarias17/Data_challenge/blob/main/shortest_node_path.py): Implements the shortest path in a node graph.
- [**valid_parenthesis.py**](https://github.com/sebasarias17/Data_challenge/blob/main/valid_parenthesis.py): Validates balanced parentheses in a string.


## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sebasarias17/Data_challenge.git
cd Data_challenge
```
Ensure you have Python installed, then you can run any of the scripts directly.

## Usage 
Each script can be run individually to solve specific problems. For example:

```bash
python maximum_gold.py
```
